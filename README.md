# Ex1 POST_PC (ex3 version)
## by Artyom Abramovich

### I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.
### I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

#### Notice: In the past I didn't understand that our exercises will be parts of one bigger app,
####            so I've thought to stick to this repository I crated for ex1 (this is why its name
####            is ex1).
